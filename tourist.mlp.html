            <p class="description"> <b>Adyanpara</b> <br>
                A natural cascading waterfall, the Adyanpara is counted amongst the best of Malappuram tourist places. Located in in the Kurmbalangodu village of Nilambur district near Malappuram, the waterfalls are a seasonal delight. 

In summers, the water runs dry and with a lesser flow, but are nonetheless similarly beautiful to look at. The waters of the falls descend down in a cascade over the rocks of the hill, with a rich variety of flora around it to make it look even more mesmerizing.
