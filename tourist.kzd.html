                Kakkayam Dam is a famous picnic spot around Kozhikode because of its scenic beauty and plenty of choices for outdoor activities. Though the dam is small in size, it more than compensates with the small waterfalls around it. Take a peek at the varieties of animals and birds that inhabit the place. Or take a boat ride along the dam and see the small waterfalls and dense forests that surround the dam. Move around and soak in the scenic beauty of the hills around the dam
