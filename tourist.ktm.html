                Aruvikkuzhi is a waterfall which is active during the monsoons of Kerala and is all dried up during summers. The place attracts a lot of visitors during the weekends as it is a popular picnic spot due to its natural surroundings. The meandering natural pathways take you to the cascading water falling over rocks.
