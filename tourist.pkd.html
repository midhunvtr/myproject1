                Palakkad Fort</b> <br>
                One of the most historically important Palakkad tourist places is the Palakkad fort or Tipuâ€™s fort. Spend a day celebrating picnic in the sprawling green grounds of the fort with your family and enjoy looking at the various statues in the complex.

Or go for a morning or evening jog on the running track running along the moat surrounding the fort. History aficionados can spend a few hours enjoying the museum located within the grounds admiring the renovation of the fort by Archaeological Survey of India.

                Located at the foothills of the majestic Western Ghats, the Malampuzha Dam is the largest reservoir in Kerala located near Palakkad. It is the perfect place to spend a day with your family walking around in the lush green gardens around and soaking in the untouched natural beauty of the place.

                The dam is a towering 2249 meters high and the backdrop of rocky-mountains with null vegetation rising above and behind make for an awe-inspiring sight
